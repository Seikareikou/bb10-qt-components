You need QtQuickTest installed to run these tests,
which is available at:

http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qtest-qml/

You can run all tests by compiling the runner:

 $ qmake
 $ make check

Or run a single test using qmlviewer:

 $ qmlviewer auto/tst_Button.qml

If you want to run only benchmarks (or auto), you
can specify the input argument to the runner:

 $ ./test_runner -input benchmarks

You might want to increase the number of iterations
for each benchmark test and make it more precise:

 $ ./test_runner -input benchmarks -iterations 200
