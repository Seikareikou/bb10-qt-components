\title Extras Components

The Extras Components introduce additional components in addition to the
components for Symbian or MeeGo.

The Extras set of components are built along with the platform. Therefore,
building the \l{Building the Qt Quick Components for Symbian}{Symbian
components} will also build the Extras components for Symbian.

\note Currently, the Extras are only feature complete on the Symbian platform.

The components are imported by declaring the following:
\code
import com.nokia.extras
\endcode
