/*!
    \qmlproperty bool ButtonColumn::exclusive

    If a buttoncolumn's \c exclusive property is \c true, the mutual exclusion
    is activated (one and only one button at a time is toggled).

    When \c true, the \c exclusive property forces the children of a
    buttoncolumn to be checkable.

    The \c exclusive property is \c true by default.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty Item ButtonColumn::checkedButton

    The read-write property \c checkedButton defines which button in a
    buttoncolumn is checked.
