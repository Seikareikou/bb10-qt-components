\title Building the Qt Quick Components for Symbian

\section1 Prerequisites

\list 1
  \o Windows XP or later
  \o Qt SDK 1.1 or later installed. This has the build
     tools for Symbian devices.
  \o Retrieve the latest source from the Qt Quick components
     repository:  \l {http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-components}.
  \o Start the \e{Qt for Desktop (MinGW)} command shell so
     you can run the following build steps from this command shell.
     Running a command shell in this way sets up the Qt environment properly.
\endlist

\section1 Configuring the Symbian Components

If you have a previous build, you should cleanup first with:
\code
mingw32-make distclean
\endcode


In the Qt Quick components repository root:

\code
configure -symbian -nomake tests
mingw32-make clean
\endcode

\section1 Building for Symbian devices

After the configure step, run:
\code
sbs -c armv5_urel
\endcode
This will build all the binaries and export the iby's, qmls etc to correct folders also for test applications. No separate install is needed.

\section1 Building for Windows

After the configure step, run the following commands (make sure you don't have any apps running in QML Viewer or the install will fail):
\code
mingw32-make
mingw32-make install
\endcode


\section1 Configuring your Environment

The components are installed in \c C:\QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.7.1\mingw\imports\Qt\labs\components, so you need to add that to your system path before you can run any components-based applications.

\section1 Testing the Components (Windows)

You can test that the components work by running one of the example applications.

\list
  \o Go to the directory: \tt{$QTCOMPONENTS/examples/symbian/gallery/}
  \o Build the example
    \code
    qmake
    mingw32-make
    \endcode
  \o Run the example
    \code
    qmlgallery.exe
    \endcode
\endlist

\section1 Building the Documentation

The Symbian documentation is generated by running the following commands after
the configuration step:
\code
mingw32-make docs
\endcode

The documentation will reside in \c{doc/html}. In addition, a \c{qch} file will
be generated and placed in \c{doc/qch}. Qt Creator and Qt Assistant can load
the documentation by importing the qch file.
