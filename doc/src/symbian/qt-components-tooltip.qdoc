    \brief
    Provides the user with a hint or contextual feedback, for example showing
    the value of a determinate progress bar.

    To display a tooltip, you need to set the text to display and a component to
    which the tooltip is connected. The tooltip can be set to visible \c true or
    \c false.

    By default, the tooltip is positioned above the object bound to its \c
    target. The tooltip will relocate itself automatically if is displayed out
    of the screen's visible area. The display position is determined in the
    following order: top, right, left, and bottom.
