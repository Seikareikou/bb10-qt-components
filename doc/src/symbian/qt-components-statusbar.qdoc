    \brief Decorates an application with system information.

    The StatusBar shows important information of the device state such as
    network type, signal strength, and battery level.

    Usually the StatusBar is anchored on top of the \l Window component. The
    height of the bar is pre-set and there is no need for the application to
    override it. The height might also change when on the device orientation
    changes.

    \snippet src/snippets/common/snippet-statusbar.qml 0

    Because the StatusBar information is important to the user, it is
    recommended to add a StatusBar instance to every application. If the
    application needs to expand the contents area over the StatusBar, the bar can
    be hidden temporarily and shown again when possible.

    You should not instantiate the StatusBar inside the \l Page component
    because the page transition effect would then also apply to the StatusBar.
