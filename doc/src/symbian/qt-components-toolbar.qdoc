    \brief
    A ToolBar is a container for providing quick access to commonly used actions.

    The ToolBar contains a current ToolBarLayout, which in turn contains tools
    such as ToolButton components.

    If there is a PageStack whose toolBar property is set to be this ToolBar,
    then the ToolBarLayout set to be the tools of the current Page will be
    automatically set as the tools of the ToolBar, using the specified \a
    transition. This occurs each time the current Page changes.

    \sa ToolBarLayout, PageStack, Page

    \section1 Using the ToolBar

    \section2 Basic Usage

    The easiest way to use a ToolBar is to declare one to be anchored to the
    bottom of your Window or Page.

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-basic.qml toolbar1

    Notice that the \a tools are declared as a ToolBarLayout, in this case a
    simple layout containing two ToolButtons is used.

    \section2 Dynamically setting the tools in a ToolBar

    In some cases, the tools required by an application Window will change
    depending on the application state. It is straightforward to set the
    current ToolBarLayout instance displayed on a ToolBar such as this example:

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-settools.qml sharedtoolbar

    In this case, a button is used to set the current tools for sharedToolBar:

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-settools.qml button5a
    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-settools.qml button5b

    Here is the corresponding ToolBarLayout declaration:

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-settools.qml toolbarlayout5a
    \dots 12
    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-settools.qml toolbarlayout5b

    However, note that if your application is using a PageStack, then it is not
    necessary to set the tools directly on the ToolBar in this way, as
    described in the section on \l { Using a ToolBar with a PageStack }

    \section2 Using a ToolBar with a PageStack

    If your application is using a PageStack to manage a number of Pages, then
    there is no need to manually set the tools belonging to the ToolBar, as the
    PageStack provides the functionality.

    Firstly, you only need to declare a single ToolBar which should be anchored
    at the bottom of the Page:

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-in-page.qml sharedtoolbar

    Set the \a toolBar property of the PageStack to the ToolBar. Remember to
    anchor the PageStack to the top of the ToolBar:

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-in-page.qml pagestack

    Next, set the tools property of each Page as follows:

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-in-page.qml page1a
    \dots 8
    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-in-page.qml page1b
    \codeline
    \dots 4

    Finally you would declare a ToolBarLayout corresponding to each page.

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-in-page.qml toolbarlayout1a
    \dots 8
    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-in-page.qml toolbarlayout1b
    \codeline
    \dots 4

    When the Page is pushed, \a setTools will be called, so that the
    ToolBar transitions are applied.

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-in-page.qml oncompleted

    \note If you want to reuse ToolBarLayout instances between pages, you
    will need to define each unique ToolBarLayout as a Component, and
    dynamically create objects as needed. In practice, for a bounded number of
    pages, it is more maintainable to create one ToolBarLayout corresponding to
    each Page.

    \section2 Using a ToolBar with a TabGroup

    TabGroup and TabButton can be used to create a multi-section design for
    your application. However, there may not be sufficient screen space to fit
    the TabBar at the top of the page, especially if the application is already
    displaying a ToolBar (for example, if there is a back button and a menu
    button required).

    Therefore, it can be a tidy solution to put the TabButton instances into
    the ToolBar itself, using the space that would otherwise have been blank
    (assuming that no other ToolButtons were needed in the middle of the
    ToolBarLayout).

    The first step is to define your ToolBar as normal:

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-with-tabbuttons.qml sharedtoolbar

    Then create the TabGroup as you would normally do for the case of a TabBar,
    but in this case you will use the ToolBar instead of the TabBar:

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-with-tabbuttons.qml tabgroupa
    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-with-tabbuttons.qml tabgroupb
    \dots 8
    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-with-tabbuttons.qml tabgroupc

    Within the TabGroup, create the Items corresponding to each tab as normal:

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-with-tabbuttons.qml tab1a
    \dots 12
    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-with-tabbuttons.qml tab1b
    \codeline
    \dots 8

    Finally, define your ToolBarLayout, but replace ToolButton instances with
    TabButton instances.

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-toolbar-with-tabbuttons.qml toolbarlayout1

    Remember:

    \list 1

        \o Ensure that you set the \a tab property correctly for each
        TabButton, as usual.

        \o Ensure that you use a ButtonRow so that the TabButton instances
        adopt the segmented appearance.

   \endlist

    \image symbian/toolbarlayout_buttonrow_tabbutton.png

    \note See the documentation for ToolBarLayout for examples of how the
    ButtonRow layout is applied within the ToolBar, and the number of
    child items that can be supported.

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty  Item ToolBar::tools

    The ToolBarLayout that contains the ToolButton components that are
    contained in the ToolBar.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty  string ToolBar::transition

    The type of transition to be used for the ToolBar when the page changes on
    the relevant PageStack. Can be one of the following:

    \list

      \o set - an instantaneous change (default)

      \o push - the toolbar animation follows the page stack push animation

      \o pop - the toolbar animation follows the page stack pop animation

      \o replace - the toolbar animation follows the page stack replace
      animation

\endlist

*/


/*!
    \qmlmethod ToolBar::setTools(tools, transition)

    This sets the \a tools for the ToolBar and the \a transition type that will
    be used when the page changes on the relevant PageStack.
