    \brief Provides a component for positioning menu items in a menu.


    MenuLayout is a Column positioner that places its child items
    vertically one on the other.

    Even thought MenuLayout can contain any type of items, it is recommended to
    build the menu with \l MenuItem items. Usage of other items as a child item
    may result in unexpected behaviour.
