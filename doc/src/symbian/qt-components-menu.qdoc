    \section1 Using Submenus

    A Menu can contain submenus that are normally implemented
    with \l ContextMenu items. The code snippet below show how to define a ContextMenu.

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-menu.qml 3a
    \dots 12
    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-menu.qml 3b

    You can integrate a submenu to a menu item by setting its
    \c MenuItem.platformSubItemIndicator property to \c true. The following code snippet
    shows how a submenu is integrated to the menu item.

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty list<Item> Menu::content
    \default

    Provides access to the items in the menu. It is recommended to
    use a single \l MenuLayout item as the menu content. Usage of
    other elements may result in unexpected behaviour.

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty int Menu::status

    Indicates the status of a menu. The possible values are as follows:

    \list
      \o \c DialogStatus.Opening - the menu is opening
      \o \c DialogStatus.Open - the menu is open and visible to the user
      \o \c DialogStatus.Closing - the menu is closing
      \o \c DialogStatus.Closed - the menu is closed and not visible to the user
    \endlist

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty Item Menu::visualParent

    This property is not used in Symbian. The menu always uses
    predefined position and fading policy.

*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod Menu::close()

    Hides the menu from the user.

    Normally a menu is closed when the user selects an item from the menu.
    Menu is also closed when the user clicks outside the menu.

*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod Menu::open()

    Shows the menu to the user. See the code snippet above for an example how
    to bind a signal to this method.
