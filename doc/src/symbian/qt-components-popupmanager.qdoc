    \qmlclass PopupManager
    \ingroup qt-components
    \since 1.0

    \brief Symbian: Provides convenience functions to track the depth of the popup stack.

    PopupManager class is only accessible via a context property called \c platformPopupManager.
    The popup manager has a \c popupStackDepth property, which holds the number
    of open popups.

    A \e popup is generic term for modal, non-fullscreen components such as
    \l Menu, \l ContextMenu, \l Dialog, \l QueryDialog and \l SelectionDialog.

    The popup manager is especially useful in cases where the application
    is controlling the active focus in an environment where hardware keys are used.
    With the popup manager, an application can decide where to restore the active focus
    whenever there are no more popups visible.

    The following example shows how the amount of open popups can be tracked using the
    popup manager. The example includes a \l Button which can be used
    to open two \l QueryDialog components. Note how the \l Connections QML element is used
    to get the popup manager's \c popupStackDepth to the dialog messages.
