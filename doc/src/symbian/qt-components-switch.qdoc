    \brief
    A Switch component provides an icon representing a physical switch that the 
    user can turn on and off.

    You can bound the Switch component to a feature that the application has to enable or 
    disable based on user's input, for example. Switch has similar usage and API as 
    \l CheckBox, except that Switch does not provide a built-in label.

    \section1 Using a Switch

    In this example the user can turn a switch on and off. In the code snippet 
    below the switch is defined. The text label is bound to the \c checked 
    property - this way the text label shows the switch's state to the user.

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-switch.qml 0

    The screenshot below illustrates the case where the user has turned the
    switch on.

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool Switch::checked

    If a switch is turned on, \c checked is \c true; otherwise \c false.

    \sa clicked
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool Switch::pressed

    When the user presses or drags the switch, the value is \c true; otherwise \c false.
*/

/*!
    \qmlsignal Switch::clicked()

    This signal is emitted when the switch state is toggled from 'on' to 'off' or vice versa.

    \sa checked
