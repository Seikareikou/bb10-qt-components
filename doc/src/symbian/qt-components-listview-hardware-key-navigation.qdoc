    \title Hardware Key Navigation on Symbian Lists

    \brief Using hardware keys to provide an alternative input method

    The Symbian-specific ListItem component has inbuilt support for handling
    'up' and 'down' hardware keys. When the ListView has focus, the 'up' key
    will decrement the current index. Similarly, the 'down' key will increment
    the current index.

    Focus can be set to the ListView using Item::ForceActiveFocus() method. For example:

    \code
    ListView {
        id: listView

        Component.onCompleted: {
            listView.forceActiveFocus()
        }
    \endcode

    If you want to use other hardware keys, the \c Keys property in the ListItem provides a mechanism for doing so. You can handle hardware key presses with the \c Keys.onPressed() and \c Keys.onReleased() handlers.

    Here is an example of a ListView delegate which deletes a list item when the
    user presses the backspace key.

    \section1 Selecting a control inside a ListItem component

    Sometimes it is necessary to select a control inside the ListItem. It is  possible to extend ListItem component to handle 'left' key and 'right' key to select a control.
