    \ingroup qt-components
    \since 1.0
    \inherits Item

    \brief Provides a component for positioning tab buttons in a tab bar.



    A tabbed interface is made up of tab buttons and content for each button.
    The TabBarLayout component has, as its children, the TabButton items of the
    interface. Each tab button item contains a reference to the page of content
    for the tab. These pages of content that are referred to must be the
    children of one TabGroup component. TabBarLayout also positions the tab
    buttons appropriately for the underlying platform and manages the change of
    focus between one tab and another, including the transition effects.

    See the TabGroup documentation for information about how to create a tabbed
    interface.
