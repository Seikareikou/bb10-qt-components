    \brief
    A buttonrow component arranges a set of buttons in a row.

    A buttonrow component acts as container for buttons or items with checked
    property. It arranges buttons in a horizontal row. Buttonrow adds
    mutual exclusion for radiobuttons and checkable buttons.

    Buttons and toolbuttons, when placed in a ButtonRow, will be stylized as
    part of a seamless, segmented-like button.
