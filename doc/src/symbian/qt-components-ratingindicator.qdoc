    Component to indicate user specified ratings.

    A rating indicator is a component that shows the rating value within the maximum allowed range according
    to the user's specification.  The user can also specify the display type to select the positive/negative
    visual.  Optionally, the user can also specify a count value that will be displayed next to the images.

    Note: When "count" is used, the height of the entire indicator is different than when it is not used.
         This is due to the font size being larger than the image size.

    \qml
        // Rating indicator with vote count
        RatingIndicator {
            value: 3
            maximumValue: 5
            count: 3
        }

        // Rating indicator without vote count
        RatingIndicator {
            maximumValue: 5
            value: 3
        }

        // Rating indicator with inverted visual
        RatingIndicator {
            maximumValue: 5
            value: 3
            inverted: true
        }
    \endqml
