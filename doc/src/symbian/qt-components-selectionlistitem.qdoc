    \brief
    Symbian: SelectionListItem is a list item showing the current value for a setting
    and optionally a label for the setting. SelectionListItem should be used with a
    SelectionDialog or Tumbler that allows the user to change the value. New value
    replaces the previousvalue in the list item.

    There are two possible layouts for the Selection ListItem
    \list
    \o Showing only the value
    \o Showing a label and the value
    \endlist
