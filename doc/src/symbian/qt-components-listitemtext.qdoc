/*!
    \qmlproperty string ListItemText::mode

    The mode property can be used to bind the mode of the ListItemText object to the mode of the parent object (ListItem). The benefit of this is that the ListItemText will be updated with the same mode as the parent object when the parent's mode changes. For example, there could be a different font or font color when the parent ListItem is pressed or when it is disabled.

    Text that is displayed in the ListItemText object is rendered according to that mode.

    \list
        \o "normal" - list item text in its usual state, not pressed or disabled or highlighted
        \o "pressed" - list item is pressed so text corresponds to that mode
        \o "highlight" - list item text is highlighted
        \o "disabled" - list item text is disabled
    \endlist
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string ListItemText::role

    The role propery of a ListItemText object indicates how the text will be styled when the text is displayed. Actual font, color and size is based on the theme. The available roles are:
    \list
      \o  "Title"
      \o  "Subtitle"
      \o  "Heading"
      \o  "SelectionTitle"
      \o  "SelectionSubTitle"
    \endlist
