    \brief
    A RadioButton is an item in a list of items where only one item can be selected
    at a time.
    
    A radio button component consists of a radio button and a line of text. Only
    one item in a list may be selected at a time. Once an item is selected, it
    can be deselected only by selecting another item. Initial item selection may
    be set at the list creation. If not set, the list is shown without a
    selection.

    When a radio button has focus, the radio button can be selected using the
    \c Qt.Key_Select, \c Qt.Key_Return and \c Qt.Key_Enter hardware keys.

    \section1 Using a radio button

    The following code creates a row with three radio buttons in it. The
    platformExclusiveGroup property of all the radio buttons is 'group' which
    is a CheckableGroup. This enforces that only one of the radio buttons can be
    selected at a time. The radio button with the text '3' is checked.
