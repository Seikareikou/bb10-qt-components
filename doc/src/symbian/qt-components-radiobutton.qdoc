    \brief
    A RadioButton is used in a list of items where only one item can be selected
    at a time.

    A radio button element consists of a radio button and a line of text. Only
    one item in a list may be selected at a time. Once an item is selected, it
    can be deselected only by selecting another item. Initial item selection may
    be set at the list creation. If not set, the list is shown without a
    selection.

    \section1 Using a radio button

    The following code creates a RadioButton list with three items in it. The
    platformExclusiveGroup property of all the radio buttons is 'group1' which
    is a CheckableGroup. This enforces that only one of the radio buttons can be
    selected at a time. Furthermore the item with the text '1' has the focus and
    the item with the text '2' is checked.
