    \brief
    A tab button has an image or a label and can be clicked by the user to
    activate a tab.

    A tabbed interface is made up of tab buttons plus content for each button. A
    tab button is usually positioned using the TabBarLayout, but other QML
    positioning mechanisms such as Row or Column can be used instead.

    Symbian: On the Symbian platform, a tab button can be also be positioned
    with the TabBar.

    \section1 Using a tab button

    When adding buttons to a layout, you need to associate a tab button with the
    content for the tab. You also set the text and/or image for the button. This
    code snippet shows a TabBarLayout set up with three tab buttons. Each button
    has a text title and refers to the id of the tab content to be associated
    with the button.

    See the TabGroup documentation for more information about creating a tabbed
    interface.
