    \brief
    A ContextMenu provides of a list of options that the user can select from.

    There are two typical use cases for the ContextMenu component. You can use
    it as a context sensitive menu that opens, for example, on an item's long
    press signal, or you can use it to show a submenu.

    The following code snippet shows how to create a ContextMenu.

    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-menu.qml 3a
    \dots 12
    \snippet src/snippets/symbian/snippet-menu.qml 3b

    See the \l Menu documentation for an example how to use a ContextMenu
    as a submenu.

/*!
    \qmlproperty list<Item> ContextMenu::content
    \default

    Provides access to the items in the context menu. It is recommended to
    use a single \l MenuLayout item as the context menu content. Usage of
    other elements may result in unexpected behaviour.

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty int ContextMenu::status

    Indicates the status of a context menu. The possible values are as follows:

    \list
      \o \c DialogStatus.Opening - the menu is opening
      \o \c DialogStatus.Open - the menu is open and visible to the user
      \o \c DialogStatus.Closing - the menu is closing
      \o \c DialogStatus.Closed - the menu is closed and not visible to the user
    \endlist

*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty Item ContextMenu::visualParent

    This property is not used in Symbian. The context menu always uses
    the predefined position and fading policy.

*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod ContextMenu::close()

    Hides the context menu from the user.

    Normally a context menu is closed when the user selects an item from the menu.
    Context menu is also closed when the user clicks outside the menu.

*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod ContextMenu::open()

    Shows the context menu to the user.
